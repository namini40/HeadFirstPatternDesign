# The observer pattern

### design principle
Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
When two objects are loosely coupled, they can interact, but have very little knowledge of each other.
Loosely coupled designs allow us to build flexible OO systems that can handle change because they minimize the interdependency between objects.
